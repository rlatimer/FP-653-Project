#Sorry I am finding it difficult to load your data but something on the lines of the code above should work. 
#---------------Vinita----------------#

#Overall comments - I learned about the usmap package. You are doing a great job trying to loop the plots and it really made me think. I like how you are using the glue function and scale_fill_continuous. I highly encourage you to look at other arguments in import, it made my life much easier. I like how you are keeping the color aesthic simple to communicate your information. It can be very difficult to parse through multiple colors. 

#I hope this review helps in some way and I would be happy to clarify any parts if that helps

#function to output new map for each month? we can do this with facet_wrap
