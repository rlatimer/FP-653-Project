# EDLD 653 Peer Review
## David Fainstein Reviewing Chris, Tess, and Rachael

Overall, I think you're off to a great start. I had to download/install a couple of things to get up to speed, and then I got your app to work! This will be a really interesting project

## Strengths
1. The skeleton of your app is working and looks very clean! I was able to toggle a button and you're clearly integrated a few neat Shiny features.
2. Interesting idea to look at the chronological changes on a nationwide map. I think you pull off a really clean deployment with succinct code. Also, the note about taking a long time to render is an important one.
3. More broadly, you've charted out a nice path to merge some school county data and share a novel vizualization

## Points of Learning
1. Almost everything you did with Plotly() was something that I could learn from. The structure/spacing of your code, use of several functions which I hadn't seen (e.g., geojson), and use of some functions that I do know (e.g., glue) in a novel way were all really neat!
2. Was not aware of the usmap and urbnmapr libraries before!

## Suggestions for Improvement
1. You're clearly off to a good start. I made a few in-line suggestions with comments. These centered around reading in data and loading libraries. It'll be really neat to see where you end up!
